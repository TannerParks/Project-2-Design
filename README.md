Queue

The functions we need to get a queue to function like the one in class would be enqueue() to add to the queue, dequeue() to subtract from the queue, and peek() to look at the topmost element of the queue.

The values we would need to know are the queue length, the queue itself, the value going into the queue, and probably the first and/or last value of the queue.

To add to a list we could iterate through the list then add or change the value of the list at that index using push(), to delete we could do the same thing but use pop() to delete the value at that index instead.

The values we would need to know are the list length, the list, the value going into the list, and the index of where that value is going.
